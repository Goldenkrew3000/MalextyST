SerialReceive:
Receives and formats incoming RS232 serial (MAX232 IC)

SerialAzControl:
Receives, formats, and uses the azimuth data to control a stepper motor
with an A4988 IC.
Issues: When AZ gets to 360 deg, it rotates around fully, fix
Libraries: StepperDriver (https://github.com/laurb9/StepperDriver)
Also only takes integer, but is definitely enough resolution for satellite
dish pointing. So no decimals, only number (can be negative, i think)
